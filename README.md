A no_std, high-performance Rust library for computing rolling statistical measures on time series data, specifically designed for statistical analysis in backtesting and live trading systems.

## Features

- **no_std compatible**: Can be used in resource-constrained environments without the standard library
- **zero-runtime-allocation design**: Optimized for backtesting and algorithmic trading systems with minimal runtime overhead
- **Generic numeric support**: Works with any float type via the `num-traits` interface
- **Rolling window computations**: Efficiently calculates statistics over fixed-size windows
- **Comprehensive statistical measures**: Over 25 different statistical functions for both single and paired time series

### Single Time Series Statistics

| Category | Functions |
|----------|-----------|
| Basic Statistics | Sum, Mean, Mode, Median, Min, Max |
| Dispersion & Volatility | Variance, Standard Deviation, Mean Absolute Deviation, Median Absolute Deviation, IQR |
| Distribution Analysis | Z-Score, Skewness, Kurtosis, Quantile |
| Regression & Trend | Linear Regression (Slope/Intercept/Angle), Linear Fit |
| Trading-Specific | Drawdown, Maximum Drawdown, Percent Change, Log Return, Rolling Diff |

### Paired Time Series Statistics

| Category | Functions |
|----------|-----------|
| Relationship Metrics | Covariance, Correlation, Beta |
| Auxiliary Calculations | Mean Product, Mean of Squares |

## Installation

```bash
cargo add ta-statistics
```

Or add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ta-statistics = "*"
```

Replace `*` with the latest version number.

## Quick Start

For single statistics (like mean):

```rust
use ta_statistics::SingleStatistics;
let mut stats = SingleStatistics::new(20);
stats.next(105.43).mean();
```

For paired statistics (like correlation):

```rust
use ta_statistics::PairedStatistics;
let mut stats = PairedStatistics::new(20);
stats.next((105.43, 23.67)).corr();
```

## Use Cases

- **Technical Indicators**: Build standard and custom technical indicators based on statistical metrics
- **Alpha Generation**: Create statistical arbitrage models using correlation and covariance
- **Risk Management**: Monitor drawdowns, volatility, and beta for position sizing and risk control
- **Performance Analysis**: Calculate return statistics and risk-adjusted metrics for strategy evaluation
- **Market Regime Detection**: Use distributional statistics like skewness and kurtosis to identify market regimes

## Performance Considerations

- Memory usage is proportional to the window size
- Delta Degrees of Freedom correction can be applied with `set_ddof(true)` for sample statistics
- Uses KahanBabuskaNeumaier algorithm for compensated summation to prevent catastrophic cancellation in floating-point operations, ensuring numerical stability in rolling calculations
- Min and max are optimized with O(1) lookup and amortized O(1) insertion time using monotonic queue data structure

## Example: Real-time Volatility Analysis

```rust
use ta_statistics::SingleStatistics;

/// Calculate normalized volatility and detect regime changes in live market data
fn analyze_volatility_regime(
    price: f64, 
    stats: &mut SingleStatistics<f64>, 
    volatility_threshold: f64
) -> Option<VolatilityRegime> {
    // Update statistics with the latest price
    stats.next(price);
 
    // Calculate current volatility metrics
    let std_dev = stats.stddev()?;
    let kurt = stats.kurt()?;
    let skew = stats.skew()?;
    
    // Detect volatility regime
    let regime = if kurt > 3.0 && std_dev.abs() > volatility_threshold {
        // Fat tails and high volatility indicate stressed markets
        VolatilityRegime::Stressed
    } else if skew < -0.5 && std_dev > volatility_threshold * 0.7 {
        // Negative skew with moderately high volatility suggests caution
        VolatilityRegime::Cautious
    } else if std_dev < volatility_threshold * 0.5 && kurt < 3.0 {
        // Low volatility and normal kurtosis indicate calm markets
        VolatilityRegime::Normal
    } else {
        // Default regime when conditions are mixed
        VolatilityRegime::Transition
    };
    
    Some(regime)
}

enum VolatilityRegime {
    Normal,      // Low volatility, efficient price discovery
    Cautious,    // Increasing volatility, potential regime change
    Stressed,    // High volatility, fat tails, risk of extreme moves
    Transition,  // Mixed signals, regime in transition
}
```

## Example: Correlation-Based Pair Monitoring

```rust
use ta_statistics::PairedStatistics;

/// Monitor correlation stability between two instruments in real-time
/// and detect statistically significant relationship breakdowns
fn monitor_pair_relationship(
    returns: (f64, f64),
    stats: &mut PairedStatistics<f64>,
    historical_corr: f64,
    z_threshold: f64,
) -> Option<PairStatus> {
    // Update statistics with latest paired returns
    stats.next(returns);
     
    // Get current correlation and beta
    let current_corr = stats.corr()?;
    let current_beta = stats.beta()?;
    
    // Calculate Z-score of correlation deviation from historical norm
    // (simplified - in practice would use Fisher transformation)
    let corr_deviation = (current_corr - historical_corr).abs();
    let stddev_estimate = (1.0 - historical_corr * historical_corr) / 
                         (stats.period() as f64).sqrt();
    let correlation_z = corr_deviation / stddev_estimate;
    
    // Determine pair status based on statistical significance
    let status = if correlation_z > z_threshold {
        // Statistically significant breakdown in correlation
        PairStatus::RelationshipBreakdown {
            z_score: correlation_z,
            current_corr,
        }
    } else if current_beta.abs() > 1.5 * historical_corr.abs() {
        // Beta has increased but correlation remains stable
        // Indicates changing volatility dynamics
        PairStatus::IncreasedSensitivity {
            beta: current_beta,
            corr: current_corr,
        }
    } else {
        // Relationship is stable
        PairStatus::Stable {
            beta: current_beta,
            corr: current_corr,
        }
    };
    
    Some(status)
}

enum PairStatus {
    Stable { beta: f64, corr: f64 },
    RelationshipBreakdown { z_score: f64, current_corr: f64 },
    IncreasedSensitivity { beta: f64, corr: f64 },
}
```
